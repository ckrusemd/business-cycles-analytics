# Business Cycles Analytics

[![deploy](https://github.com/ckrusemd/business-cycles-analytics/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ckrusemd/business-cycles-analytics/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

From data collected from the [St. Louis Federal Reserve API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/) and [Statistics Denmark API](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/brug-statistikken/muligheder-i-statistikbanken/api), this is a JupyterBook of visualizations and time series analyses of key business cycle indicators.

Using the [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) framework right now. Will be looking into [Greykite](https://github.com/linkedin/greykite) as well.

You should be able to see the book at:
